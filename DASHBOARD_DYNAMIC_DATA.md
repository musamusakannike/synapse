# Dashboard Dynamic Data Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of dynamic data for the Synapse dashboard, replacing hard-coded placeholder values with real user data.

## Overview

The dashboard now fetches and displays actual user data instead of static placeholder values, providing users with accurate insights into their learning progress and activity.

## Changes Made

### Server-Side Implementation

#### New Files Created:
- `server/controllers/dashboard.controller.js` - Dashboard data controller
- `server/routes/dashboard.route.js` - Dashboard API routes

#### New API Endpoints:

1. **GET /api/dashboard/stats**
   - Returns user statistics (documents, chats, topics, quizzes, websites count)
   - Requires authentication

2. **GET /api/dashboard/progress**
   - Returns user progress data:
     - Study streak (consecutive days with activity)
     - Estimated study time (based on activity count)
     - Topics mastered count
   - Requires authentication

3. **GET /api/dashboard/activity?limit=5**
   - Returns recent user activities from the last 7 days
   - Includes activity type, description, timestamp, and formatting data
   - Requires authentication

### Frontend Implementation

#### Updated Files:
- `frontend/src/components/DashboardOverview.tsx`

#### Key Changes:
1. **Added new interfaces:**
   - `UserProgress` - For progress tracking data
   - `RecentActivity` - For activity history data

2. **Replaced hard-coded values:**
   - Study streak: Now calculated from actual user activity
   - Study time: Estimated based on user activities (15min average per activity)
   - Topics mastered: Uses actual topic count from user data
   - Recent activity: Shows real user activities with proper timestamps

3. **Added helper functions:**
   - `getIconComponent()` - Maps icon names to React components
   - `getRelativeTime()` - Formats timestamps to relative time strings

4. **Enhanced error handling:**
   - Fallback to individual endpoints if dashboard endpoints fail
   - Empty state display when no recent activity exists

## Data Calculations

### Study Streak
- Calculated by checking consecutive days with any user activity
- Looks back up to 30 days
- Activity types: chats, documents, topics, quizzes

### Study Time Estimation
- Based on total number of activities in the last 30 days
- Uses 15 minutes average per activity
- Formatted as "Xh Ym"

### Recent Activity
- Fetches activities from the last 7 days
- Sorted by creation date (most recent first)
- Limited to 5 items by default
- Includes proper icon and color coding

## Testing

A test script has been created at `test-dashboard.js` to verify the endpoints are working correctly.

To test:
1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Obtain a valid JWT token by logging in
3. Update the test script with the token
4. Run: `node test-dashboard.js`

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Data**: Users see their actual progress and activity
2. **Real-time Updates**: Dashboard reflects current user state
3. **Better UX**: More engaging and personalized experience
4. **Scalable**: Easy to add more metrics and insights
5. **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation if new endpoints fail

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- More sophisticated study time tracking
- Achievement badges and milestones
- Weekly/monthly progress comparisons
- Goal setting and tracking
- Activity heatmaps and charts
